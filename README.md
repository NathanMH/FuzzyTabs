* About this extension:

Quickly search (fuzzily!) through all your open tabs/bookmarks to switch to/open instantly.

Inspired by the 'helm' package for Emacs (specifically the helm-buffers-list command).

Works great with other tab extensions such as Tree Style Tab.

Will open tabs in other windows

* Usage:

  1. Default keybinding is Ctrl-Shift-F
  2. Seach for keywords, snippets, or any string in a tab title
  3. Enter key will automatically open the first result
  4. Use the tab key to focus the item and enter to select (or just use the mouse!)

* Future Updates:

  - Custom keybindings
  - Custom colour options

  - Add option to allow/disallow typos
